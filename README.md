# Printf Project

Welcome to the **Printf Project**! In this project, I will be implementing my own version of the `printf` function in C, which allows me to format and print text in various ways. This README provides important information about the project, its requirements, and how to get started.

## General Information
- **Project:** Printf Project
- **Language:** C
- **Compiler:** gcc on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Editor:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Repository:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/your-username/printf)

## Project Requirements
Before I begin working on the project, I should ensure that I am aware of the following requirements:

- All code files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Each code file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- My code should adhere to the Betty style, and I should check it using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- I should not use global variables in my code.
- I need to include a `README.md` file at the root of my project folder.
- The prototypes of all my functions should be included in a header file named `main.h`.
- I should make sure to push my header file and include guards in all header files.
- The project should be developed in a GitHub repository. Only one team member should create the repository, and others should not fork or clone it to avoid scoring 0%.
- I am allowed to use specific functions and macros, as mentioned in the project requirements.

## Compilation
To compile my code, I should use the following command:

`$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c`


I should remember not to include any C file with a `main` function in the root directory of my project, as the provided `main` files will be used at compilation.

## Examples
I can find example `main.c` files in the project's GitHub repository. These examples can be used to test my functions, but I don't need to push them to my repository. The provided `main.c` files might differ from the ones shown in the examples.

## Tasks
The project consists of the following tasks:

### Task 0: I'm not going anywhere...
I should implement a function `_printf` that produces output according to a given format. The function should handle the conversion specifiers `c`, `s`, and `%`.

### Task 1: Education is when you read the fine print...
I should extend my `_printf` function to handle the conversion specifiers `d` and `i`.

For detailed requirements and additional information, I can refer to the task descriptions provided in the project's GitHub repository.
